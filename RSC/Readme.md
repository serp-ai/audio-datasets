The dataset is posted to [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com/hazalkl/RSC), where you may preview it before downloading it.

### About:
Extract runescape classic sounds from cache to wav (and vice versa). Jagex used Sun's original .au sound format, which is headerless, 8-bit, u-law encoded, 8000 Hz pcm samples. This module can decompress original sounds from sound archives as headered WAVs, and recompress (+ resample) new WAVs into archives.

### Structure:

The audio files are in `.wav` format and sampled at `8 kHz`
