# Public Domain Sounds

Good for wake word detection; a wide array of sounds that can be used for object detection research. This is a backup of the 635 copyright-free sound recordings submitted to pdsounds.org before April 2009.

**The similar version of dataset is uploaded to DagsHub: [Public Domain Sounds](https://dagshub.com/kingabzpro/Public_Domain_Sounds), enabling you to preview the dataset before downloading it.**

## Organization of the dataset

The dataset is small (543MB) and simple to navigate as it has only two folders based on audio format. The `mp3` folder contains mp3 audio files whereas `otherformats` folder contains all other formats such as `flac` and `au` . We also have an `Audio_Files_Description.md` file, which contains details about the ever audio files in dataset. The audio files rand from 5 seconds to 5 minutes. A representation of the directory structure can be seen in the ASCII diagram below.

```
<root directory>

    .- README.md

    .- Audio_Files_Description.md

    .- otherformats/

          |
          .- 2month_baby_gabbling.mp3
          | ...
```

- **Audio_Files_Description.md**: contains detail description about each audio file.
- **otherformats**: the folder containing various audio format.

## History

pdsounds.org was a [Drupal](http://drupal.org/)-based sharing platform for public domain sound recordings: a mixture of [Freesound](http://freesound.org/) and [Open Clip Art Library](http://openclipart.org/).

On March 2, 2009, an archive of all previously submitted sounds was uploaded to pdsounds.org. It went down a few weeks later.

pdsounds.org is [back](http://pdsounds.org/) apparently. See [this thread](http://librivox.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19186).
