### About:
The Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 was used to create these stimuli (NU-6; Tillman & Carhart, 1966). Two actresses (aged 26 and 64 years) recited a set of 200 target words in the carrier phrase "Say the word _____," and recordings were produced of the set depicting each of seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, and neutral). There are a total of 2800 stimuli.
Two actresses from the Toronto region were cast. Both actresses are university educated and have musical training, and they speak English as their native language. Both actresses' audiometric thresholds were found to be within the usual range.

### Structure:
A man and a woman provided the voices for the audio recordings. There are 1400 audio files and 200 words per individual. The audio files are in `.wav` format. Each phrase is said in one of seven different emotional moods. Each file has around 2 seconds of audio recorded in it. The following is an example structure:
+ `(man/woman) _ (word) _ (emotion).wav`

E.g:
+ `OAF_back_angry.wav`

OAF indicates the male voice, YAF indicates the female voice.
